### UI Components

- Component folders under `app/components/**`; keep base primitives in `base/**` (buttons, icons, inputs, uploader, etc.).
- Larger features (chat, workflow) live in their own folders with `index.tsx` and submodules.
- Prefer colocated `style.module.css` or Tailwind classes. Global styles in `app/styles/**`.
- Use `app/components/base/toast` for error/display notifications.
- Avoid unnecessary client components; mark with `'use client'` only when needed (state, effects, browser APIs).
