# Conversation Web App Template
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Config App
Create a file named `.env.local` in the current directory and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Setting the following content:
```
# APP ID: This is the unique identifier for your app. You can find it in the app's detail page URL. 
# For example, in the URL `https://cloud.dify.ai/app/xxx/workflow`, the value `xxx` is your APP ID.
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=

# APP API Key: This is the key used to authenticate your app's API requests. 
# You can generate it on the app's "API Access" page by clicking the "API Key" button in the top-right corner.
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_KEY=

# APP URL: This is the API's base URL. If you're using the Dify cloud service, set it to: https://api.dify.ai/v1.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
```

Config more in `config/index.ts` file:   
```js
export const APP_INFO: AppInfo = {
  title: 'Chat APP',
  description: '',
  copyright: '',
  privacy_policy: '',
